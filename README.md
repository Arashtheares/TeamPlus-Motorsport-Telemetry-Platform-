# TeamPlus Motorsport Telemetry Platform

A modernised telemetry and data-management platform designed for motorsport teams, providing real-time visualisation, session recording, and file-management capabilities. The system was rebuilt to replace an outdated interface and introduce robust, scalable functionality for drivers and crew members.

## 🚗 Project Overview
The original TeamPlus platform lacked several essential capabilities, including:
- A modern, intuitive user interface  
- Reliable telemetry visualisation  
- File-management tools for driving sessions  
- Playback speed control and multi-format video export  
- Clear documentation for future development  

This project redesigned the platform using **Django, HTML/CSS/JS, and AWS**, resulting in a significantly improved system.
